A few notes:

-	If you are looking to statically compile an application, you must compile it
	without the use of either rtti or exceptions.  The library should be compiled
	likewise.  Since the application will be statically compiled, you may run a 
	dynamic library with exception support.

-	As of version 0.1.11 uClibc+ throws LOTS of warnings when compiling about inline
	functions used but never defined.  There warnings are known errors in GCC
	versions 3.3.3 3.4.0 4.0.0 4.1.0 [Bug #21627].  Either ignore these warnings or
	upgrade your compiler.  Note that these warnings will exist when compiling software
	as well as the library itself.
