0.1.5 - 2004-09-26
-	Added code for all algorithms
-	Fixed map/set code to prevent infinite loops.  Oops.
-	Fixed list code to prevent most memory leaks.  1 still remains, but unknown location
-	stlport v 1.00 test suite now compiles, links and runs.  Some issues remain
-	Fix deque constructor using the wrong end_pointer value
-	Added erase capability to vector
-	Changed multimap::find to point to first matching element instead of any matching element
-	Added more tests to test suite based upon problems from stlport test suite
-	Altered istream_iterator template so that it handles begining of stream conditions properly
-	Fixed make_heap and sort_heap functions to sort in the correct order
-	Fixed a few pedantic errors in std::string as it relates to the vector base
-	All (known) stlport issues have been resolved.  Compiles and runs properly.


0.1.4 - 2004-09-10
-	Fixed minor previous errors
-	Added <algorithm> heap functions.  Just treat as a descending sorted list
-	Added more code to <valarray>
-	Added <, <=, >, >= comparisons to deque iterators (don't know why I missed them in the first place)
-	Making Makefiles a little bit better.

0.1.3 - 2004-09-06
-	Compiles with gcc 3.4, thus it is far more "correct" than previously
-	Started adding code for valarray


0.1.2 - 2004-09-05
-	Completed all core code for set, multiset, map and multimap.  Rewrote to use inheritance to cut code duplication
-	Added more algorithms
-	Now compiles the stlport 1.0 testsuite (some minor changes to not test extensions needed)
-	Does not yet link stlport testsuite - missing implementations of a number of functions
-	Added sort algorithm - using a bubble sort for now.
-	sort_stable will likely remain bubble sort for some time (It is both stable and in-place)
-	sort will likely be converted to a heap sort eventually (It is in-place, but non-stable)
-	List sort is a bubble sort.  Might change later (insertion sort?), but it is difficult to work with list limitations
-	Split iterator code into two sections to cut down on dependency hell
-	Compiles ncurses c++ library and test application


0.1.1 - 2004-09-01

-	Removed semicolons on the closing of namespaces.  My compiler doesn't warn, so I may have missed one or two
-       Fixed a problem with the istream code which caused it to fail to read in the first character of input.
-       Changed compiler flags to not generate some warnings on >=GCC 3.4
-       Changed build process to prevent misconfiguration under certain circumstances
-       Added stringstream and all of it's incarnations
-       Added <bitset>
-       Added <set> - code is considered 'under development' - not finished


0.1.0 - 2004-08-28
-	Nearly done all algorithms
-	Added some SGI extensions
-	Completed numerics libraries
-	Only multimap has yet to be started of containers
-	Lots of bug fixes
-	Coompiles all of the stlport C++ STL tests up to mmap1.cpp (no multimap)
