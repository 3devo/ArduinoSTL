//This file lists everybody who has sent me bug problems/fixes as of Jan 24, 2005
//The list will be in order of total number of points, with the most at the top
//Anybody who sends me a bug listing with some sample code gets 1 point
//If that sample code is a minimal test case, it becomes 2 points
//If a patch or usable instructions for correction are included, it is 3 points
//Note that I am the final arbiter on how many points a bug report is worth
//I reserve the right to alter any and all bug points at a whim without any recourse
//Functionality that isn't part of the standard isn't included
//Stuff that hasn't been implemented yet doesn't count
//Saying "this piece of software doesn't work" doesn't count
//I reserve the right to modify the rules at any point without notice
//I suggest killing all the lawyers
//Using the bug tracking system at bugs.uclibc.org gets you a bonus point
